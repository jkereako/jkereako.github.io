I am a sofware developer who just surpassed 6 years in the professional world. I
contract as an iOS developer for [NOAA Fisheries][garfo].

I spent over 3 years at [NESN][nesn] as a WordPress developer where I made a
[native iPhone app][nesn-mobile]—yes, I know it has horrible reviews but in my defensethe app had bad reviews before my date of hire—and automated the posting
of their [TV schedule][nesn-tv-schedule]. I wrote several WordPress plugins and
interacted directly with the folks at Automattic.

I truly enjoy programming. I work on side projects and maintain this blog to
stay sharp and relevant. I will often upload my code to GitHub.

When I'm not writing code, I'm mixing cocktails. You will find some articles on
this blog related to mixology. My favorite cocktail is the Manhattan and my
favorite spirit is Gin.
