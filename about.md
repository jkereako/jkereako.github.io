Hi there. I'm Jeff, a software developer currently employed with [DraftKings]
where I help build the iOS app.

I truly enjoy programming. I work on side projects and maintain this blog to
stay sharp and relevant. I will often upload my code to GitHub.

When I'm not writing code, I'm mixing cocktails. You will find some articles on
this blog related to mixology. My favorite cocktail is the Manhattan and my
favorite spirit is Gin.
