*Blink* provides insight and scientific explanation to gut reactions. It does
this through a series of examples.

I've mentioned before that I don't like non-fiction and this was no exception.
The format was pretty boring (each chapter was a case study), but overall idea
was interesting. For example, a gut reaction, according to Malcolm, is a hint
from the unconscious to the conscious. The unconscious mind recognizes a pattern
and passes this information to the conscious mind. But, because the conscious
mind didn't originally recognize the pattern, the person is unable to explain a
reason for his feeling.

The unconscious mind is built from information gathered by the conscious mind,
so folks can actually train their unconscious mind by absorbing information,
consciously.  Not all of information will trickle down into the unconscious, but
the information that does will stay there for a lifetime.
