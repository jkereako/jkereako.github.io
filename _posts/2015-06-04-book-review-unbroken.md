*Unbroken* follows the story of a first generation Italian immigrant, Louie
Zamperini, in Torres, Calif. from his days as a track athlete to a bombardier in
World War II.

The first half of the book details Louie's efforts and success on the track
field. He did so well he competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

Eventually, Louie is drafted into the war and serves as a bombardier on the
Pacific front. His bomber is shot down in the Pacific and he and another guy
float on a shoddy raft for 47 days (this is the most exciting part of the book)
until they are captured by the Japanese. For the remainder of the war, they are
beaten and abused in POW camps until their release in 1945.

That's about it.

I don't particularly like non-fiction unless it's information on a person I
truly am interested in. Like, for instance, Thomas Jefferson. Non-fiction
writers tend to be boring, and Laura Hillenbrand (the author of this book) is
certainly boring.
