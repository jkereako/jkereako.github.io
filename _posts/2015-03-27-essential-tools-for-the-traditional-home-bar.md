There is a lot of garbage out there which tells you what you need to start your home bar. This article will add to that garbage pile.

Also, by "traditional" I mean pre-prohibition era. So, no vodka and no tequila.

# Essentials
You need everything in this list.

- **[This bar spoon](http://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Twisted-Swizzle-Cocktail-Tableware/dp/B00L2WGJSC/)**. It doubles as a spoon and muddler.
- **[This jigger](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Steel-Angled-Measuring-Jigger/dp/B00B6LUAPW/)**.
- **Boston Shaker**. It's just a pint glass and a tin. You can buy one or make one yourself.
- **Hawthorne strainer**
- **Gin**. If you don't like gin, it's probably because you took shots of it in high school or college. Learn to appreciate it. Get Beefeater.
- **Rye whiskey**. Before bourbon there was rye. Get Old Overholt
- **Rum**. Because rum was mass produced in Colonial New England, it is the main ingredient in many old time cocktails (punches, actually). Get "gold rum". That is, *unflavored*, *unspiced*, barrel-aged rum.
- **Angostura bitters**.
- **Vermouth, dry and sweet**.
  - *Dry*. This doesn't appear in many cocktails and a lot of folks don't like it. Get the smallest bottle you can find.
  - *Sweet*. Alone it can be a drink. Get a regular sized bottle
- **[This ice cube tray](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-King-Cube-Ice-Tray/dp/B00395FHRO)**. The most important ingredient in a cocktail is the ice. You need large cubes to keep the drink cooler for longer without quickly diluting the drink
- **Demerara sugar**.
- **Lemons, limes and oranges**. Don't use powdered sour mix. *Ever*.
- **A peeler**. You want the citrus peel, *not* the pith, which is bitter. The easiest way to do this is with a peeler.
- **Old fashioned glasses**. Also known as low ball glasses and whiskey glasses.

# Friendly advice
- **Only shake when mixing with citrus juice.** Stir the cocktail otherwise.
- **Aim for a volume of 3 ounces.** This will provide enough to really taste the drink without getting you cocked.
- **If the drink is too strong, then dilute it with water**. For example, do not pour more sweet vermouth into a strong Manhattan, it will actually make it stronger and throw off the taste.
- **Make simple syrup as you need it**. This stuff will grow mold if you make it ahead of time and don't use it within a week. Simple syrup is simple to make. Make it to order.
- **Store vermouth in the refrigerator and use it within 3 months.** An open bottle of wine has a shelf life, and although vermouth is a fortified wine, it is foremost still a wine.
- **Serve all of your cocktails in old fashioned glasses.** Cocktail glasses, also known as martini glasses are awkward to hold and easy to spill.
