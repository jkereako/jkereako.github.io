# Description
This is the source code for my personal website [jeffkereakoglow.com](http://jeffkereakoglow.com). I will use this as a notepad for ideas simply so I can remember them. Most of the writings will be code related, but other stuff will find its way in here as well. 

This site, like all other GitHub pages, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
