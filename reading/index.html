      Reading is a life-skill. In fact, it was a computer science professor who made me realize this. <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~canning/101/101.html" target="_blank" title="91.101 Computing I">Computing I with Jim Canning</a> included an introduction to programming with C as well as <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37134" target="_blank"><b>The Elements of Style</b></a>, the preamble to the Constitution, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044706/" target="_blank" title="High Noon"><b>High Noon</b></a> and <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/" target="blank" title="Flatland: A romance of many dimensions"><b>Flatland</b></a>. <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~canning/TeamGauss.html" target="_blank" title="Jim's Enrichment Program">Here's the webpage for his enrichment program</a>. Notice the healthy mix of programming with fiction.

      I'm in the middle of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonesome-Dove-Novel-Larry-McMurtry/dp/1439195269" target="_blank">Lonesome Dove</a></b>. It's a western written by Larry McMurtry. Never have read anything like it before but it was recommended to me by my best bud.
