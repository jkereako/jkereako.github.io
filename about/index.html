<p>
  At the time of this writing, I work as an iOS developer and on the side I develop applications in Ruby and Python. I'm currently making a Ruby gem just for the hell of it.
</p>

<p>
  I truly enjoy coding and it is a skill I try to improve, but I didn't come to this until I left my last job at <a href="http://nesn.com/">NESN</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I spent over 3 years at NESN as a "WordPress developer" where I made their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nesn-mobile-sports-news-scores/id387404738?ls=1&mt=8">iPhone app</a>—yes, I know it has horrible reviews but in my defense the app always sucked—and automated the posting of their <a href="http://nesn.com/tv-schedule/">TV schedule</a>.
</p>

<p>
  After hours I'm an amatuer mixologist. A couple times a week I'll mix cocktails for the wife and I. She digs the Daiquiri and I like the Manhattan. It's near impossible to find a bar with a cocktail list outside of the city.
