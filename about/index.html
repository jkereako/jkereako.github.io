  I contract as an iOS developer for <a href="https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov" target="_blank">NOAA Fisheries</a> and on the side I develop applications in Ruby and Python. I'm currently making a Ruby gem just for the hell of it.
</p>

<p>
  I truly enjoy coding and it is a skill I try to improve, but I didn't come to this until I left my last job at <a href="http://nesn.com/">NESN</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I spent over 3 years at NESN as a WordPress developer where I made a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nesn-mobile-sports-news-scores/id387404738?ls=1&mt=8">native iPhone app</a>—yes, I know it has horrible reviews but in my defense the app sucked before my date of hire—and automated the posting of their <a href="http://nesn.com/tv-schedule/">TV schedule</a>. I wrote several WordPress plugins and interacted directly with the folks at Automattic.

<p>
  After hours I'm an amatuer mixologist. A couple times a week I'll mix cocktails for the wife and I. She like the Daiquiri and I like the Manhattan.
