      I am a sofware developer who just surpassed 6 years in the professional world. I contract as an iOS developer for <a href="https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov" target="_blank"><abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration" class="initialism">NOAA</abbr> Fisheries</a>.

      I spent over 3 years at <a href="http://nesn.com" target="_blank"><abbr title="New England Sports Network" class="initialism">NESN</abbr></a> as a WordPress developer where I made a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nesn-mobile-sports-news-scores/id387404738?ls=1&mt=8">native iPhone app</a>—yes, I know it has horrible reviews but in my defense the app sucked before my date of hire—and automated the posting of their <a href="http://nesn.com/tv-schedule/">TV schedule</a>. I wrote several WordPress plugins and interacted directly with the folks at Automattic.

      I truly enjoy programming. I work on side projects and maintain this blog to stay sharp and relavent. I will often upload my code to GitHub.

      When I'm not writing, I'm mixing cocktails. You will find some articles on this blog related to mixology. My favorite cocktail is the Manhattan and my favorite spirit is Gin.
